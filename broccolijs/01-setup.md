First things first, it is assumed that you know how to use a terminal on your machine, if you're unfamiliar with the
terminal, best get familiar with that first.

You're also going to want to use Node 8 as this is the current LTS (long term support) version.

We're going to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) instead of `npm` to ensure our dependencies are in lock step.

Create a new directory for this tutorial and install broccoli:


```sh
mkdir broccoli-tutorial
cd broccoli-tutorial
yarn init -y
yarn add --dev broccoli@beta broccoli-cli
```

The above command will add broccoli and broccoli-cli as dev dependencies of your project. The CLI tool can also be
installed globally if you wish, it just checks some basic dependencies in the current project before running the main
broccoli library.

In your `package.json` add the following to the `scripts` node (add this if it's not present):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "broccoli build --overwrite",
    "serve": "broccoli serve"
  }
}
```

You can now use `yarn build` and `yarn serve` for convenience.

### Debugging

If you use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or an Intellij product from [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)
you can enable interactive debugging via a few simple steps. First, replace the scripts above with the following:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node $NODE_DEBUG_OPTION $(which broccoli) build --overwrite",
    "serve": "node $NODE_DEBUG_OPTION $(which broccoli) serve"
  }
}
```

#### VSCode

After this, you'll need the files in [this directory](https://github.com/oligriffiths/broccolijs-tutorial/tree/00-init/.vscode).

Once you have those in your project, you'll see the `Build - Debug` and `Serve - Debug` in your debug tab, see
[the VSCode docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) for more details on debugging.

#### Intellij

Select `Run > Edit Configurations` from the menu bar, click the `+` in the top right hand corner, and select `npm`.
Name the configuration `Build`, ensure `run` is selected in the `command` entry, and select `build` from the `scripts`
dropdown, and hit apply. Repeat for the `serve` script.

You can now add breakpoints by clicking in the column to the left of the line numbers (on the left) and then proceed to
invoke a debugging session:

## The build file

Broccoli uses a file called `Brocfile.js` that must live in the root of your project, this is what will contain your
build pipeline.

So create a `Brocfile.js` in the root of your project, with the contents: 

```js
// Brocfile.js
module.exports = "app";
```

Next, create a directory `app` within the project, and add a `index.html` file with the contents `Eat your greens!`.

```sh
mkdir app
echo 'Eat your greens!' > app/index.html
```

That's it, you're done.

The initial setup of this tutorial merely copies files from the input `app` directory by exporting the string `app`.
The `Brocfile.js` contains the Broccoli configuration for the build. The `module.exports` line must export a Broccoli
tree. "But it's a string" you say, yes, Broccoli will automatically convert a string into a `source node`, and on build,
validate that the directory exists. In this case, the Brocfile merely exports a single tree, containing the contents of
the `app` directory, this will then be copied to the destination directory (`dist` in our case).

To run a build, run `yarn build` (if you added the script) or `rm -rf dist && broccoli build dist`.
You should see something like:

```sh
$ yarn build
$ rm -rf dist
‚ú®  Done in 1.05s.
```

This yarn command will remove any previous builds, and run a new build, outputting to the `dist` directory.
Broccoli doesn't remove previous builds by default, so we must remove it before starting a new build.

The contents of `app` should now be in the `dist` directory. Try:

```sh
$ cat dist/index.html
Eat your greens!
```

Now try running `yarn serve` or `broccoli serve` and you should see:

```sh
$ yarn serve
Serving on http://localhost:4200




Built - 0 ms @ Wed Mar 28 2018 11:25:30 GMT-0400 (EDT)
```

You will see the URL `http://localhost:4200`, if you open this in the browser, you should see:

Great, your first Broccoli build is complete, pat yourself on the back üëè.
